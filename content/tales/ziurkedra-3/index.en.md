As she sat down on the musky dock, the rain kept battering her now oh-so-muddy precious fur. "Why did I travel here" - she thought. "We don't know" - the sea, and the wind wept, or perhaps it was just the waves. 

One thing she knew for sure - home it was not, and could never be. Home was were the good things stayed. She looked into her hands, now dirty with ink from her 12 step guide. "Perhaps I'm not a cannibal rat at all, in the end" - she thought. 

The book fell into the water, old pages dissolving at the seams, notes dissapearing, reclaimed into where we all began. Ratsnack stood up, looked around, and went home. She must persist.
