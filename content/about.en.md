Out beyond the balcony window, where the distance opens up, is a special place. Adventures hide there—big journeys and deeds. Mysterious stream valleys that braid through Lithuania, deep springs where you could sink into the sand. Crooked trees—proof that a witch might once have lived here.

Sometimes tales are needed not only by children, but by grown-ups too. I’d even say they sometimes need them more. That’s true for me as well—so here I write down the stories I create in spare time after work, the drawings, the songs.

These tales are listened to by the whole family—nine-year-old Augustas evaluates the scribbling. Four-year-old Benediktas listens and decides whether it’s nonsense or not. My wife—clearly the most morally mature person in the family—just smiles, though sometimes she smiles a bit wider.

Some of the tales even have maps—on weekends you can try to follow them and visit the places you read about.

Stay a while, come back again—updates here are frequent, and things are never finished and can change. And if you’re an adult—I promise, no one will know; everyone here is sunk into twilight.

Sincerely yours,
Kasparas
