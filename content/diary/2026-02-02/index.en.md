Today I started posting on reddit. This is something I wanted for a while, but never found time or, perhaps, courage to do. I started with /r/SketchDaily, a subreddit where one posts images drawn according to the theme of that day. 

![A Dusky Batfish](./rat_at_twilight__2026-02-02_for_publish.resized.jpg "A Dusky Batfish")

Since I'm trying to learn ink, drew the theme of the day - the "Dusky Batfish" using it. For some self-critique, I clearly once again thought that "unplanned, rough, quick" strokes will somehow equate into a natural, easy going, naive look. This always dissapoints though, and it just looks as if I need to ... keep learning, which I do :) . As I keep repeating to myself, the "easy, child-like" lines are actually learned by lots of practice, not lazy stroking as I initially kind of hoped for.. 

Note the wildly uneven shading on the outline of the fish - if I already decided to do it, I should have done it properly. Should have used more precise, determined strokes  (even if the intention is "a rough, uneven look"). Will take more care next time. 

I like the top part of the fish though where the lines are nice, and also happy with the general composition. 

Other than that, I'm happy to have started posting.
