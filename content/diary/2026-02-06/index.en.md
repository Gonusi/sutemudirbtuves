This week I was learning to draw using pen and ink. Quite different experience from using an iPad - I enjoyed it greatly. I plan to do this for quite awhile. 

All the sketches were made for the [https://reddit.com/r/SketchDaily](SketchDaily) subreddit. 

![A Dusky Batfish](./2026-02-02-dusky-batfish_for_publish.resized.jpg "A Dusky Batfish")
"A dusky batfish" - what a weird, beautiful fish. Not fully reflected in the sketch though :) 

![Mark your place](./2026-02-03-mark-your-place.resized.jpg "Mark your place")
"Mark your place" - I really like how the trolls look, but ruined the rat lair. Too many various dots, inconsistent lines etc.

![Cat as if drawn in the middle ages](./2026-02-04-cat-as-if-drawn-in-the-middle-ages_for_publish.resized.jpg "Cat as if drawn in the middle ages")
"Cat as if drawn in the middle ages" - well, turns out cats in the middle ages were drawn as these horrifying creatures. Do google them. 

![Dappled shadows](./2026-02-05-dappled-shadows_for_publish.resized.jpg "Dappled shadows")
"Dappled shadows" - this was my favorite work from this week. The intention was for the circular things to be the shadow for the tree, but I overdid it, and now they look like... walking stones? as they're everywhere. Still like it. 

![Park run has eyes](./2026-02-06-park-run-has-eyes_for_publish.resized.jpg "Park run has eyes")
Free friday - drew a copy of a photo I took during todays long run in the park at night. It's always a bit scary there, but as long as I keep going...
